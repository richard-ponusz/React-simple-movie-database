# About this Simple Movie Site React App

IMPORTANT: This app is under construction so probably won't work as of yet!

---

This is just a practice playground repository to have fun with.

## How to make it work?

1. Create an account on: https://www.themoviedb.org/
2. When you have an account, go to: https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
3. Here find and copy the 'API Read Access Token (v4 auth)' key
4. in the src/SimpleMovieSite/service/api.js set the accessToken to this code.
5. All done, now it should work fine!

## Used technologies

Newest of everything, just like how a playground should be:

- React: Newest available version (17.0.1 at the time)
- EmotionJS: for getting familiar with 'css-in-js'. First time I am using it.
- Axios: Getting the movies
